## üé≤ What is Kobold Keeper?

Kobold Keeper is a powerful, self-hosted API designed to manage and automate dice-rolling tasks for **role-playing game (RPG) sessions**, focusing primarily on game master (GM) utility. It serves as a backend hub for various tools, allowing GMs to centralize data, run complex dice rolls, and review dice rolling statistics per group, character or even globally.

This project is built with Python and Django Rest Framework (DRF), offering a robust, secure, and scalable foundation for your digital tabletop needs.

### Key Features

* **Advanced Dice Roller:** Supports complex algebraic expressions, `drop/keep` logic, and modifiers (e.g., `3d6 + 5`, `2d20kh1`, `1d8 + 5d6 + 4`).
* **Roll analytics:** Allows users to review their past and present rolls in terms of raw dice breakdown, averages and comparisons versus statistical averages of the standard dice type
* **Secure User Management:** Full authentication and authorization via Django's built-in system and custom JWT logic.
* **Asynchronous Tasks (Celery):** Handles long-running or resource-intensive tasks, such as large data exports or complex simulations, without blocking the main API thread.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Getting Started

To run Kobold Keeper locally for development or as a self-hosted instance, you'll need **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. This setup ensures all dependencies (**PostgreSQL** database, **Redis** cache, **Celery worker**, and **Celery Beat scheduler**) are managed easily.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your system.
2.  A `.env` file created in the project root (see `Example.env` for structure).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pooch41/kobold-keeper-api.git
cd kobold-keeper-api
```

### 2. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment file and update the variables for production or development use.

```bash
cp Example.env .env
# Edit .env to set secure keys, database credentials, and any external service tokens.
```

### 3. Build and Run Services (Recommended)

Execute the following command to build the Docker images and start all five required services (`api`, `worker`, `beat`, `db`, `redis`) in detached mode:
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

**Note:** The `start.sh` script inside the `api` container automatically handles waiting for the database, running `migrate`, and running `collectstatic` on startup.

The API will be available @ `http://localhost:8000`.

**API Schema (Swagger UI):** `http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui/`

### 4. Access the API

Once the services are running and healthy (this may take a few seconds), the API will be available at:

**API Root:** `http://localhost:8000/api/`.

**API Schema (Swagger UI):** `http://localhost:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui/`


## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Testing
The project uses **Pytest** for unit and integration testing, configured via `pytest.ini`. All tests must be executed within the Docker environment to ensure connectivity to the database.

### Running Pytest
Use `docker compose run --rm api pytest` to execute the tests inside a temporary container.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Celery Workers & Scheduled Tasks

The application uses Celery for background processing.

* **Worker:** The `worker` service executes tasks asynchronously (e.g., large-scale data computations).

* **Beat:** The `beat` service is the scheduler that polls the database for periodic tasks defined in `django_celery_beat` and queues them for the worker.

To monitor the activity of the workers and beat scheduler:

### View all logs in real-time
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```
## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

This project follows a standard Django structure with clearly defined application responsibilities:

| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `api/` | Main application logic for Django REST Framework views, serializers, and permissions, including business logic related to dice rolling and authentication. |
| `kobold_keeper/` | Core Django settings, URLs, and root configuration for the entire project, **including Celery setup**. |
| `docs/` | **Future home for dedicated documentation (e.g., `API_REFERENCE.md`).** |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Defines the multi-container environment (API, DB, Cache, Worker, Beat). |
